x Kernel module:

    x - Implement a single-core monotonic source
    
    x Setup the preempt-notifier
    
        x init:
        - set last sample
        - set running total to 0
        
        x sched in:
        - set last sample
        - running total is unaffected
        
        x sched out:
        - compute difference from last sample
        - update running total
        - last sample is now meaningless
        
        x read:
        - compute difference from last sample
        - update running total
        - set last sample
    
    x - Implement a ktime based source

x MOCsample + PeSORTA:
    - design a command-line interface
    - implement the interface
    - write a Makefile
