    - write start command to module
        - command contains:
            - period
            - count
        - allocate memory buffer for count samples and time stamps
        - setup time-based sampling structure
        - structure is contained in the MOC structure
            - the period
            - the count
            - samples obtained so far
            - pointer to the memory buffer
            - the hrtimer
        - sample the first sample and time stamp
        - setup timer with above period
        
    - on timer callback
        - access the time-based sampling structure
        - read the next sample
        - get the current time
        - store the sample and time in the buffer
        - check if the limit is reached:
            - stop the timer
        - else
            - advance the couter in the buffer
            - advance the timer by the sampling period
            - restart the timer
    
    - write command to get the samples
        - command arguments
            - size of buffer array
            - number of valid elements
            - pointer to buffer
        - copy the arguments from the user
        - update the argument with the number of valid samples
        - copy the samples to the user-space buffer
        - copy the updated argument back into user space
