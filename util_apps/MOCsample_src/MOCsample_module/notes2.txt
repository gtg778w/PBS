    - on timer callback
        - access the time-based sampling structure
        - read the next sample
        - get the current time
        - store the sample and time in the buffer
        - check if the limit is reached:

        - command arguments
            - size of buffer array

        - copy the samples to the user-space buffer
        - copy the updated argument back into user space
