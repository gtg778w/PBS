List of Experiments
-------------------

    1) invariance of VIC
    3) performance of the VIC-based budget mechanism
        - response to successive step-changes in execution time resulting from changes in CPU frequency for the membound workload in the most memory-bound configuration
            - 200 jobs
            - 2 reservation period per task period
            - 10ms reservation periods
            - 6ms execution times at highest frequency
            - switch the CPU frequency every second (50 jobs)
            - use the hybrid predictor
            - run the allocator for 800 reservation periods
            - run the cpu frequency oscillator for 6 seconds
            - plot execution time
            - plot VFT error
            - plot VIC
            - plot VFT error
        - performance of time-based budget and VIC-based budget measured in terms of miss-rate vs bandwidth.
            - at a constant high frequency (0.9)
                30 runs with VIC
                30 runs with ns
            - at a constant low frequency (0.0)
                30 runs with VIC
                30 runs with ns
            - with the frequency oscillating rapidly (0.65)
                30 runs with VIC
                30 runs with ns

        - allow for 5 minutes per run
        - (6 * 30 * 5)
            
Notes on How Bandwidth Should Change with CPU Frequency
-------------------------------------------------------

    Consider the case of perfect execution-time prediction.
    
        As the CPU frequency decreases, execution-time increases, reservation-period lengths remain the same, the bandwidth necessary is going to increase.
        
        As the CPU frequency decreases, the VIC remains the same, the VIC capacity of the reservation-period decreases, the bandwidth should increase.
